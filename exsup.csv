The Soviet troops brought with them all kinds of equipment and weapons, including several squadrons of fighter aircraft and air defence. Their aim was to first establish control over larger cities and major roads, thereafter to deploy troops to the border areas to limit incursion from Pakistan and Iran, and finally to disarm unreliable elements of the Afghan army.   In mid-1980 the Soviets started to remove some of the troops and tanks from Afghanistan. From a total of 1000 tanks in the beginning of the year, the number was down to around 300 in the end of 1980 and the troops were reduced by 5000 men in June 1980. The reduction in troops was compensated by an increase in the number of fighter helicopters and other types of aircraft. At the end of the year there were about 130 Soviet jet fighters in Afghanistan. The Soviet Union also spent a lot of money improving the military infrastructure in Afghanistan, for instance by constructing permanent logistics- and communications facilities and by improving airfields.

When in Pakistan, all military aid was handled by the Pakistan Inter-Services Intelligence, ISI, who transported the arms to the Afghan resistance groups' headquarters in Quetta and Peshawar and distributed them among the six Sunni parties. The parties then brought the arms to border dumps for the commanders in Afghanistan to come and pick them up.  In Pakistan, the question of aid to the Afghan rebels was politically sensitive, as they worried about Soviet retaliation if it was revealed that the Pakistani government supported the Mujahideen.

Pakistan also administered training for the Afghan resistance and from 1981 there were Pakistani soldiers situated in Afghanistan as military advisers to the commanders.  The bulk of the weapons that the United States and Saudi Arabia provided for the Mujahideen was purchased in Egypt and China, but both Egypt and China also sporadically provided weapons as aid. Egypt openly stated that they supported the Afghan resistance. Defence Minister Kamal Hassan announced in early 1980 that Egypt would provide training to the Afghan fighters, and that the combatants would return to Afghanistan with Egyptian weapons.

While the United States continued to officially deny their involvement in Afghanistan, Carter, on 9 January 1980, authorised a program of covert military assistance to the Moslem insurgents. His successor Reagan expressed in March 1981 his willingness to supply the Mujahideen. In a joint action with Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and to some extent, China, the United States started transferring large quantities of arms to the resistance groups in Afghanistan. Until 1985 only communist-block weapons were bought, in an attempt to hide the fact that the United States were giving the Mujahideen material support. Weapons from China and Egypt were shipped to Karachi or, on some occasions, flown to Islamabad in American, Saudi, Chinese or Pakistani planes. When in Pakistan, all military aid was handled by the Pakistan Inter-Services Intelligence, ISI, who transported the arms to the Afghan resistance groups' headquarters in Quetta and Peshawar and distributed them among the seven Sunni parties. The parties then brought the arms to border dumps for the commanders in Afghanistan to come and pick them up.  In Pakistan, the question of aid to the Afghan rebels was politically sensitive, as they worried about Soviet retaliation if it was revealed that the Pakistani government supported the Mujahideen. There is no evidence that Pakistan provided weapons for the rebels, but they handled almost all the aid, military and financial, that was given to the Mujahideen by others. Pakistan only recognized seven resistance groups in 1984; Mahaz-i Milli-yi Islami-yi Afghanistan, Jabha-yi Nijat-i Milli-yi Afghanistan, Harakat-i Inqilab-i Islami-yi Afghanistan, Jam'iyyat-i Islami-yi Afghanistan, Hizb-i Islami-yi Afghanistan, Ittihad-i Islami Bara-yi Azadi-yi Afghanistan, Hizb-i Islami-yi Afghanistan - Khalis faction. All the support for the Mujahideen that was distributed by Pakistan was divided among those seven on a percentage basis, where Hizb-i Islami-yi Afghanistan received around 20 percent of the resources. Pakistan also administered training for the Afghan resistance and from 1981 there were Pakistani soldiers situated in Afghanistan as military advisers to the commanders.  The bulk of the weapons that the United States and Saudi Arabia provided for the Mujahideen was purchased in Egypt and China, but both Egypt and China also sporadically provided weapons as aid. Egypt openly stated that they supported the Afghan resistance. Defence Minister Kamal Hassan announced in early 1980 that Egypt would provide training to the Afghan fighters, and that the combatants would return to Afghanistan with Egyptian weapons. In December 1980 Egyptian President Anwar Sadat said in a TV-interview that Egypt would send more arms, as well as medicine and food, to the Moslem rebels in Afghanistan. When President Sadat was assassinated in October 1981, aid to the Afghan Mujahideen decreased significantly and possibly stopped. How many guerrillas that received training in Egypt, and how many arms that were given to the Afghan resistance by Egypt remains unknown. China, on the other hand, never admitted that they supported the Mujahideen.  One of the largest donors was Saudi Arabia which contributed roughly the same amount of money as the United States. In 1984 they provided around $80 million each. Although most of the weapons bought by the United States and Saudi Arabia for the Afghan resistance were shipped to Pakistan, Saudi Arabia occasionally flew in arms deliveries to airports in Rawalpindi and Islamabad.  Iran made several statements supporting the Afghan resistance, but supplied little, if any, material aid to the rebel groups.  There are also reports that the Gulf States were providing the Moslem guerrillas with financial aid. However, large parts of the funds seem to have been donated by individuals and it is unclear if the governments of these states were involved in supporting the Afghan resistance. "

",0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,"The resistance groups in Afghanistan were supported by many governments and private donors; although many of them did not openly admit that they were giving aid to the Mujahideen. The rebel groups themselves also denied that they were receiving training and weapons from foreign sources. Instead, they claimed that their weapons were captured from the Afghan army and that former Afghan soldiers, who had now joined the resistance, were providing them with training.   Although the United States had started to support the Mujahideen on a small scale already in 1979, it was not until after the Soviet invasion that the rebels could count on extensive American aid. While the United States continued to officially deny their involvement in Afghanistan, Carter, on 9 January 1980, authorised a program of covert military assistance to the Moslem insurgents. His successor Reagan expressed in March 1981 his willingness to supply the Mujahideen. In a joint action with Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and to some extent, China, the United States started transferring large quantities of arms to the resistance groups in Afghanistan. Until 1985 only communist-block weapons were bought, in an attempt to hide the fact that the United States were giving the Mujahideen material support. Weapons from China and Egypt were shipped to Karachi or, on some occasions, flown to Islamabad in American, Saudi, Chinese or Pakistani planes. When in Pakistan, all military aid was handled by the Pakistan Inter-Services Intelligence, ISI, who transported the arms to the Afghan resistance groups' headquarters in Quetta and Peshawar and distributed them among the seven Sunni parties. The parties then brought the arms to border dumps for the commanders in Afghanistan to come and pick them up.  In Pakistan, the question of aid to the Afghan rebels was politically sensitive, as they worried about Soviet retaliation if it was revealed that the Pakistani government supported the Mujahideen. There is no evidence that Pakistan provided weapons for the rebels, but they handled almost all the aid, military and financial, that was given to the Mujahideen by others. Pakistan only recognized seven resistance groups in 1983; Mahaz-i Milli-yi Islami-yi Afghanistan, Jabha-yi Nijat-i Milli-yi Afghanistan, Harakat-i Inqilab-i Islami-yi Afghanistan, Jam'iyyat-i Islami-yi Afghanistan, Hizb-i Islami-yi Afghanistan, Ittihad-i Islami Bara-yi Azadi-yi Afghanistan, Hizb-i Islami-yi Afghanistan - Khalis faction. All the support for the Mujahideen that was distributed by Pakistan was divided among those seven on a percentage basis, where Hizb-i Islami-yi Afghanistan received around 20 percent of the resources. Pakistan also administered training for the Afghan resistance and from 1981 there were Pakistani soldiers situated in Afghanistan as military advisers to the commanders.  The bulk of the weapons that the United States and Saudi Arabia provided for the Mujahideen was purchased in Egypt and China, but both Egypt and China also sporadically provided weapons as aid. Egypt openly stated that they supported the Afghan resistance. Defence Minister Kamal Hassan announced in early 1980 that Egypt would provide training to the Afghan fighters, and that the combatants would return to Afghanistan with Egyptian weapons. In December 1980 Egyptian President Anwar Sadat said in a TV-interview that Egypt would send more arms, as well as medicine and food, to the Moslem rebels in Afghanistan. When President Sadat was assassinated in October 1981, aid to the Afghan Mujahideen decreased significantly and possibly stopped. How many guerrillas that received training in Egypt, and how many arms that were given to the Afghan resistance by Egypt remains unknown. China, on the other hand, never admitted that they supported the Mujahideen.  One of the largest donors was Saudi Arabia which contributed roughly the same amount of money as the United States. In 1983 they provided around $50 million each. Although most of the weapons bought by the United States and Saudi Arabia for the Afghan resistance were shipped to Pakistan, Saudi Arabia occasionally flew in arms deliveries to airports in Rawalpindi and Islamabad.  Iran made several statements supporting the Afghan resistance, but supplied little, if any, material aid to the rebel groups.  There are also reports that the Gulf States were providing the Moslem guerrillas with financial aid. However, large parts of the funds seem to have been donated by individuals and it is unclear if the governments of these states were involved in supporting the Afghan resistance. "

The Soviet troops brought with them all kinds of equipment and weapons, including several squadrons of fighter aircraft and air defence. Their aim was to first establish control over larger cities and major roads, thereafter to deploy troops to the border areas to limit incursion from Pakistan and Iran, and finally to disarm unreliable elements of the Afghan army.   In mid-1980 the Soviets started to remove some of the troops and tanks from Afghanistan. From a total of 1000 tanks in the beginning of the year, the number was down to around 300 in the end of 1980 and the troops were reduced by 5000 men in June 1980. The reduction in troops was compensated by an increase in the number of fighter helicopters and other types of aircraft. At the end of the year there were about 130 Soviet jet fighters in Afghanistan. The Soviet Union also spent a lot of money improving the military infrastructure in Afghanistan, for instance by constructing permanent logistics- and communications facilities and by improving airfields.

Pakistan only recognized seven resistance groups in 1982; Mahaz-i Milli-yi Islami-yi Afghanistan, Jabha-yi Nijat-i Milli-yi Afghanistan, Harakat-i Inqilab-i Islami-yi Afghanistan, Jam'iyyat-i Islami-yi Afghanistan, Hizb-i Islami-yi Afghanistan, Ittihad-i Islami Bara-yi Azadi-yi Afghanistan, Hizb-i Islami-yi Afghanistan - Khalis faction. All the support for the Mujahideen that was distributed by Pakistan was divided among those seven on a percentage basis, where Hizb-i Islami-yi Afghanistan - Khalis faction received around 13-15 percent of the resources. Pakistan also administered training for the Afghan resistance and from 1981 there were Pakistani soldiers situated in Afghanistan as military advisers to the commanders.  The bulk of the weapons that the United States and Saudi Arabia provided for the Mujahideen was purchased in Egypt and China, but both Egypt and China also sporadically provided weapons as aid. Egypt openly stated that they supported the Afghan resistance. Defence Minister Kamal Hassan announced in early 1980 that Egypt would provide training to the Afghan fighters, and that the combatants would return to Afghanistan with Egyptian weapons. In December 1980 Egyptian President Anwar Sadat said in a TV-interview that Egypt would send more arms, as well as medicine and food, to the Moslem rebels in Afghanistan. When President Sadat was assassinated in October 1981, aid to the Afghan Mujahideen decreased significantly and possibly stopped. How many guerrillas that received training in Egypt, and how many arms that were given to the Afghan resistance by Egypt remains unknown. China, on the other hand, never admitted that they supported the Mujahideen.  One of the largest donors was Saudi Arabia which contributed with roughly the same amount of money as the United States. In 1982 they provided around $50 million each. Although most of the weapons bought by the United States and Saudi Arabia for the Afghan resistance were shipped to Pakistan, Saudi Arabia occasionally flew in arms deliveries to airports in Rawalpindi and Islamabad.  Iran made several statements supporting the Afghan resistance, but supplied little, if any, material aid to the rebel groups.  There are also reports that the Gulf States were providing the Moslem guerrillas with financial aid. However, large parts of the funds seem to have been donated by individuals and it is unclear if the governments of these states were involved in supporting the Afghan resistance. "

The bulk of the weapons that the United States and Saudi Arabia provided for the Mujahideen was purchased in Egypt and China, but both Egypt and China also sporadically provided weapons as aid. Egypt openly stated that they supported the Afghan resistance. Defence Minister Kamal Hassan announced in early 1980 that Egypt would provide training to the Afghan fighters, and that the combatants would return to Afghanistan with Egyptian weapons. In December 1980 Egyptian President Anwar Sadat said in a TV-interview that Egypt would send more arms, as well as medicine and food, to the Moslem rebels in Afghanistan. When President Sadat was assassinated in October 1981, aid to the Afghan Mujahideen decreased significantly and possibly stopped. How many guerrillas that received training in Egypt, and how many arms that were given to the Afghan resistance by Egypt remains unknown. China, on the other hand, never admitted that they supported the Mujahideen.  One of the largest donors was Saudi Arabia which contributed roughly the same amount of money as the United States.

From 1985 an onwards, the military aid to the resistance was more openly discussed than in previous years and the US together with the UK provided both UK-built anti-aircraft missiles, and American Stinger missiles to the Mujahideen.  In Pakistan, the question of aid to the Afghan rebels was politically sensitive, as they worried about Soviet retaliation if it was revealed that the Pakistani government supported the Mujahideen. There is no evidence that Pakistan provided weapons for the rebels, but they handled almost all the aid, military and financial, that was given to the Mujahideen by others.

All the support for the Mujahideen that was distributed by Pakistan was divided among those seven on a percentage basis, where Ittihad-i Islami received around 17-18 percent of the resources. Pakistan also administered training for the Afghan resistance and from 1981 there were Pakistani soldiers situated in Afghanistan as military advisers to the commanders.  The bulk of the weapons that the United States and Saudi Arabia provided for the Mujahideen was purchased in Israel and China, but China also sporadically provided weapons as aid. However, they never admitted that they supported the Mujahideen.  One of the largest donors was Saudi Arabia which contributed roughly the same amount of money as the United States. In 1988 they provided around $600 million each. Although most of the weapons bought by the United States and Saudi Arabia for the Afghan resistance were shipped to Pakistan, Saudi Arabia occasionally flew in arms deliveries to airports in Rawalpindi and Islamabad.  There are also reports that the Gulf States were providing the Moslem guerrillas with financial aid. However, large parts of the funds seem to have been donated by individuals and it is unclear if the governments of these states were involved in supporting the Afghan resistance. "

Their aim was to first establish control over larger cities and major roads, thereafter to deploy troops to the border areas to limit incursion from Pakistan and Iran, and finally to disarm unreliable elements of the Afghan army.   In mid-1980 the Soviets started to remove some of the troops and tanks from Afghanistan. From a total of 1000 tanks in the beginning of the year, the number was down to around 300 in the end of 1980 and the troops were reduced by 5000 men in June 1980. The reduction in troops was compensated by an increase in the number of fighter helicopters and other types of aircraft. At the end of the year there were about 130 Soviet jet fighters in Afghanistan.

They assured that they were respecting the principle of non-interference in Afghanistan's internal affairs. During the year the relations between Afghanistan and Pakistan deteriorated as Pakistan accused Afghanistan of violating their air space and carrying out bombing raids on Pakistani territory.   The Soviet Union and Afghanistan also accused China, the US and several Arab countries of supporting the rebels, for example were Egyptian representatives in Pakistan believed to provide the Moslem rebels with large sums of money. The government of China officially denied that they were backing the rebels and argued that it was just a Soviet attempt to cover up their interference in Afghanistan's internal affairs. The US State Department also rejected the accusations and stated that they expected the principle of non-interference to be respected by all parties, including the Soviet Union. However, some sources argue that the US started supporting the Afghan rebels, through an almost invisible program, in April 1979. Immediately after the Soviet invasion in December 1979, US President Carter authorised a program of covert military assistance to the Moslem insurgents. Weapons were bought in Egypt and transported to the Mujahideen via Pakistan. Pakistan reportedly had three preconditions to allow such a transfer; no public acknowledgements were to be maid, all supplies had to be immediately moved from Pakistani territory to Afghanistan, and a maximum of two planeloads a week was allowed. Saudi Arabia reportedly provided $1-2 million to the rebels fighting the Afghan government in 1979. "

Instead, they claimed that their weapons were captured from the Afghan army and that former Afghan soldiers, who had now joined the resistance, were providing them with training.   Although the United States had started to support the Mujahideen on a small scale already in 1979, it was not until after the Soviet invasion that the rebels could count on extensive American aid. While the United States continued to officially deny their involvement in Afghanistan, Carter, on 9 January 1980, authorised a program of covert military assistance to the Moslem insurgents. In a joint action with Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and to some extent, China, the United States started transferring large quantities of arms to the resistance groups in Afghanistan. Until 1985 only communist-block weapons were bought, in an attempt to hide the fact that the United States were giving the Mujahideen material support. Weapons from China and Egypt were shipped to Karachi or, on some occasions, flown to Islamabad in American, Saudi, Chinese or Pakistani planes. When in Pakistan, all military aid was handled by the Pakistan Inter-Services Intelligence, ISI, who transported the arms to the Afghan resistance groups' headquarters in Quetta and Peshawar and distributed them among the six Sunni parties. The parties then brought the arms to border dumps for the commanders in Afghanistan to come and pick them up.  In Pakistan, the question of aid to the Afghan rebels was politically sensitive, as they worried about Soviet retaliation if it was revealed that the Pakistani government supported the Mujahideen. There is no evidence that Pakistan provided weapons for the rebels, but they handled almost all the aid, military and financial, that was given to the Mujahideen by others. Pakistan only recognized six resistance groups in 1980; Mahaz-i Milli-yi Islami-yi Afghanistan, Jabha-yi Nijat-i Milli-yi Afghanistan, Harakat-i Inqilab-i Islami-yi Afghanistan, Jam'iyyat-i Islami-yi Afghanistan, Hizb-i Islami-yi Afghanistan and Hizb-i Islami-yi Afghanistan - Khalis faction. All the support for the Mujahideen that was distributed by Pakistan was divided among those six on a percentage basis, where Jam'iyyat received around 18-19 percent of the resources. Pakistan also administered training for the Afghan resistance and from 1981 there were Pakistani soldiers situated in Afghanistan as military advisers to the commanders.  The bulk of the weapons that the United States and Saudi Arabia provided for the Mujahideen was purchased in Egypt and China, but both Egypt and China also sporadically provided weapons as aid. Egypt openly stated that they supported the Afghan resistance. Defence Minister Kamal Hassan announced in early 1980 that Egypt would provide training to the Afghan fighters, and that the combatants would return to Afghanistan with Egyptian weapons. In December 1980 Egyptian president Anwar Sadat said in a TV-interview that Egypt would send more arms, as well as medicine and food, to the Moslem rebels in Afghanistan. How many guerrillas that received training in Egypt, and how many arms that were given to the Afghan resistance by Egypt is still not known. China, on the other hand, never admitted that they supported the Mujahideen.  One of the largest donors was Saudi Arabia which contributed with roughly the same amount of money as the United States. In 1980 Saudi Arabia granted 24 million dollars to the Mujahideen while the United States provided between 20 and 30 million dollars. Although most of the weapons bought by the United States and Saudi Arabia for the Afghan resistance were shipped to Pakistan, Saudi Arabia occasionally flew in arms deliveries to airports in Rawalpindi and Islamabad.  Iran made many statements supporting the Afghan resistance, but supplied little, if any, material aid to the rebel groups. However, some training was provided for Afghan guerrillas in Iran.  There are also reports that the Gulf States were providing the Moslem guerrillas with financial aid.

The parties then brought the arms to border dumps for the commanders in Afghanistan to come and pick them up.  In Pakistan, the question of aid to the Afghan rebels was politically sensitive, as they worried about Soviet retaliation if it was revealed that the Pakistani government supported the Mujahideen. There is no evidence that Pakistan provided weapons for the rebels, but they handled almost all the aid, military and financial, that was given to the Mujahideen by others. Pakistan only recognized seven resistance groups in 1983; Mahaz-i Milli-yi Islami-yi Afghanistan, Jabha-yi Nijat-i Milli-yi Afghanistan, Harakat-i Inqilab-i Islami-yi Afghanistan, Jam'iyyat-i Islami-yi Afghanistan, Hizb-i Islami-yi Afghanistan, Ittihad-i Islami Bara-yi Azadi-yi Afghanistan, Hizb-i Islami-yi Afghanistan - Khalis faction. All the support for the Mujahideen that was distributed by Pakistan was divided among those seven on a percentage basis, where Jam'iyyat- Islami received around 18-19 percent of the resources. Pakistan also administered training for the Afghan resistance and from 1981 there were Pakistani soldiers situated in Afghanistan as military advisers to the commanders.  The bulk of the weapons that the United States and Saudi Arabia provided for the Mujahideen was purchased in Egypt and China, but both Egypt and China also sporadically provided weapons as aid. Egypt openly stated that they supported the Afghan resistance. Defence Minister Kamal Hassan announced in early 1980 that Egypt would provide training to the Afghan fighters, and that the combatants would return to Afghanistan with Egyptian weapons. In December 1980 Egyptian President Anwar Sadat said in a TV-interview that Egypt would send more arms, as well as medicine and food, to the Moslem rebels in Afghanistan. When President Sadat was assassinated in October 1981, aid to the Afghan Mujahideen decreased significantly and possibly stopped. How many guerrillas that received training in Egypt, and how many arms that were given to the Afghan resistance by Egypt remains unknown. China, on the other hand, never admitted that they supported the Mujahideen.  One of the largest donors was Saudi Arabia which contributed roughly the same amount of money as the United States. In 1983 they provided around $50 million each. Although most of the weapons bought by the United States and Saudi Arabia for the Afghan resistance were shipped to Pakistan, Saudi Arabia occasionally flew in arms deliveries to airports in Rawalpindi and Islamabad.  Iran made several statements supporting the Afghan resistance, but supplied little, if any, material aid to the rebel groups.  There are also reports that the Gulf States were providing the Moslem guerrillas with financial aid. However, large parts of the funds seem to have been donated by individuals and it is unclear if the governments of these states were involved in supporting the Afghan resistance. "

The rebel groups themselves also denied that they were receiving training and weapons from foreign sources. Instead, they claimed that their weapons were captured from the Afghan army and that former Afghan soldiers, who had now joined the resistance, were providing them with training.   Although the United States had started to support the Mujahideen on a small scale already in 1979, it was not until after the Soviet invasion that the rebels could count on extensive American aid. While the United States continued to officially deny their involvement in Afghanistan, Carter, on 9 January 1980, authorised a program of covert military assistance to the Moslem insurgents. His successor Reagan expressed in March 1981 his willingness to supply the Mujahideen. In a joint action with Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and to some extent, China, the United States started transferring large quantities of arms to the resistance groups in Afghanistan. Until 1985 only communist-block weapons were bought, in an attempt to hide the fact that the United States were giving the Mujahideen material support. Weapons from China and Egypt were shipped to Karachi or, on some occasions, flown to Islamabad in American, Saudi, Chinese or Pakistani planes. When in Pakistan, all military aid was handled by the Pakistan Inter-Services Intelligence, ISI, who transported the arms to the Afghan resistance groups' headquarters in Quetta and Peshawar and distributed them among the seven Sunni parties. The parties then brought the arms to border dumps for the commanders in Afghanistan to come and pick them up.  In Pakistan, the question of aid to the Afghan rebels was politically sensitive, as they worried about Soviet retaliation if it was revealed that the Pakistani government supported the Mujahideen. There is no evidence that Pakistan provided weapons for the rebels, but they handled almost all the aid, military and financial, that was given to the Mujahideen by others. Pakistan only recognized seven resistance groups in 1982; Mahaz-i Milli-yi Islami-yi Afghanistan, Jabha-yi Nijat-i Milli-yi Afghanistan, Harakat-i Inqilab-i Islami-yi Afghanistan, Jam'iyyat-i Islami-yi Afghanistan, Hizb-i Islami-yi Afghanistan, Ittihad-i Islami Bara-yi Azadi-yi Afghanistan, Hizb-i Islami-yi Afghanistan - Khalis faction. All the support for the Mujahideen that was distributed by Pakistan was divided among those seven on a percentage basis, where Mahaz-i Milli-yi Islami-yi Afghanistan received around 10 percent of the resources. Pakistan also administered training for the Afghan resistance and from 1981 there were Pakistani soldiers situated in Afghanistan as military advisers to the commanders.  The bulk of the weapons that the United States and Saudi Arabia provided for the Mujahideen was purchased in Egypt and China, but both Egypt and China also sporadically provided weapons as aid. Egypt openly stated that they supported the Afghan resistance. Defence Minister Kamal Hassan announced in early 1980 that Egypt would provide training to the Afghan fighters, and that the combatants would return to Afghanistan with Egyptian weapons. In December 1980 Egyptian President Anwar Sadat said in a TV-interview that Egypt would send more arms, as well as medicine and food, to the Moslem rebels in Afghanistan. When President Sadat was assassinated in October 1981, aid to the Afghan Mujahideen decreased significantly and possibly stopped. How many guerrillas that received training in Egypt, and how many arms that were given to the Afghan resistance by Egypt remains unknown. China, on the other hand, never admitted that they supported the Mujahideen.  One of the largest donors was Saudi Arabia which contributed with roughly the same amount of money as the United States. In 1982 they provided around $50 million each. Although most of the weapons bought by the United States and Saudi Arabia for the Afghan resistance were shipped to Pakistan, Saudi Arabia occasionally flew in arms deliveries to airports in Rawalpindi and Islamabad.  Iran made several statements supporting the Afghan resistance, but supplied little, if any, material aid to the rebel groups.

There were also reports of Iran providing arms and materiel to the Taleban in Afghanistan.   The US and ISAF claimed in 2007 that Iran was supporting the Taleban and other insurgency groups in Afghanistan through providing them with armaments. Evidence of this was scarce however, meaning that no final conclusions could be drawn in regard to secondary support from Iran to the Taleban.  It has been thought that the Taleban have cooperated with Hekmatyar's Hezb-i-Islami group for years, carrying out joint operations and cooperated in different ways. Reports surfaced in 2007 that this cooperation had ceased, but other reports also stated the contrary. It is thus unclear whether or not the Taleban received support from this source. "

Reports and rumours constantly suggest cooperation and support being passed between the Taleban and al-Qaeda. It is, however, difficult to substantiate such reports. For instance, Sirrajudin Haqqani - a Taleban commander widely thought to be the facilitator of al-Qaeda infiltration into Afghanistan - stated in 2009 that the Taleban have ""brotherly ties with al-Qaeda"" but that they do not receive any support from them. Also, statements in 2009 from the head of the Taleban, Mullah Omar, and Taleban spokesman Zabihollah Mujahid suggested a deepening rift with al-Qaeda (over al-Qaeda's global ambitions as opposed to the Taleban's national one) more than a stance of cooperation.

In early December 1985, Libyan leader Colonel Gaddafi publicly proposed to instate a 'linking system' with Burkina Faso, an alliance intended to reinforce the countries' relations. Gadhafi stated that the arrangement would entitle Burkina Faso to anything it needed, and for the two countries to act in unison in a number of matters. According to some accounts, Libya provided funds, and it is unlikely that Burkina Faso would have decided on a 'general mobilisation' against Mali unless Gadhafi had given him his backing. Further on, reports from the time of the 1985 clashes indicated that Burkina Faso had recently received a Libyan delivery of arms. Burkina Faso's closest ally in 1985, however, is said to have been Ghana. The Ghanaian head of state, Jerry Rawlings, enjoyed close collaborative relations with Burkinabe head of state Thomas Sankara, whom he gave both material and moral support in the latter's 1983 coup d'état. In early 1984 Sankara had confirmed that Ghana provided the country with military, diplomatic and political support.

Although it should be noted that the Sudanese government support and influence over the Chadian rebel groups are higher than the Chadian influence over the groups they support in Sudan. An example of the control Sudan has over the Chadian rebel is that when Erdimi was selected leader for UFR it was suggested that this was a choice done by the Sudanese government. It was suggested that they thought that if Erdimi was leader the chances for widespread defection within the Chadian army would be higher.

The company and its founding members were convicted in 2009 to 2-6 months of conditional prison for supporting terrorist organizations. Venezuela has publicly and openly supported FARC politically since the Colombian government kidnapped/arrested FARC leader Rodrigo Granda on Venezuelan territory in 2005. Colombia claims this support goes as far back as 1999, when Chavez gained power in Venezuela, and that support takes the form of access to territory, money and/or weaponry.

",0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,"The September 20 coup attempt had been carefully planned and prepared by soldiers associated with former ruler General Gue. The planning took place in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso, where the group, subsequently named MPCI, received crucial help from Burkinabe president Blaise Compaoré. The full extent of the Burkinabe government's involvement in the planning is not clear, but initiated analysts have concluded that apart from allowing the coup plotters to operate on Burkinabe territory, MPCI also received logistic help as well as arms. Furthermore, it appears as if the Burkinabe help was not confined to the preparation phase, as senior Burkinabe officials have indicated that after the coup attempt failed and the fighting spread throughout the country, arms were delivered directly by air to Bouaké, an important rebel held city in northern Ivory Coast. The logic behind Burkina Faso's support of the rebels is clear. Campaoré has a long record of involvement in the Western African conflicts over the past decade. From 1989 to 1999, he directly financed present Ivorian president Gbago and his party, FPI, then in opposition. After Gbago came to power in 2000, relations soured, however. He adopted a number of policies, which clearly went against Burkinabe interests, predominantly the reversal of the historic flow of immigrants. The treatment of the numerous Burkinabe immigrants already in Ivory Coast led to large flows of returnees, who needed to be reintegrated into Burkina Faso's society. Apart from this problem, the decreasing numbers of Burkinabes working abroad also meant that the inflow of badly needed remittances declined."

Since the rivalry between the KDP and the PUK had once again risen and this time turned the KDP from fighting Iraq to fighting the PUK, with Iraq even supporting the KDP with artillery and armour during some battles, the PUK was in need of Iranian support. Since the Iranian president Rafsanjani and the PUK leader Talabani claims that no Iranian forces fought alongside PUK forces during 1996 Iran is not labelled a secondary warring party. Most sources did however agree that Iran provided other forms of secondary support.

The support primarily consisted of technology transfer, provision of safe haven, and loan of weapons such as the RPG (rifle propelled grenades). The military also claimed that the MILF's special operations group in Maguindanao had been teaching bomb-making techniques to the NPA fighters operating in Sarangani and Davao provinces. Statements from NPA and MILF confirm that they have formed a tactical alliance sharing technology and training, but MILF denies that they would assist NPA in battle, if it is not in areas where MILF already has active forces.  Comments from rebel spokesmen suggest that their mutual support has been going on for years. The military has also repeatedly claimed that MILF and ASG have carried out joint attacks and that MILF has provided shelter for ASG rebels fleeing military operations.  MILF are said to have reinforced ASG during clashes with the armed forces, most notably in Al-barka town on Basilan Island December 7 where 11 people died. MILF spokesman Kabalu denied that they were sheltering ASG and said that both groups have camps in the area.

To support Sudan was cold war strategy from US. Soviet supported Ethiopia and the United States wanted a counter weight in this part of Africa. The U.S. had made heavy financial investments in Sudan and was concerned by how the developments in the south affected the oil company's ability to drill for oil in the destabilized region in the south. As a consequence Pentagon sent '˜security evaluation and assistance team' to Sudan. The team was observing the Sudanese army and was to evaluate its efficiency. Further, a possible operational option would be dispatch of US special forces to train the Sudanese counter-insurgency. In December 1983, US marines were reportedly stationed at Rub Kona to protect the security of Chevrons explorations in Bentiu area."

China was reported to have begun directing more and more of its support to the Khmer Rouge and substantially decreasing its support to CPT. This was further compounded by the attempts of the Beijing leadership to normalize relations with Thailand. As such, in 1979, VOPT was shut down. Further, relations with Vietnam and Laos degraded substantially, as the CPT kept a very rigid pro-Chinese position, condemning Vietnam's invasion of Cambodia.

Through the accord, Uganda and Sudan committed themselves to end all support to rebel forces on each other's territories and by signing it, the diplomatic relations between the two countries resumed.

In a November interview with the rebel group's director of operations, 'Lt-Col' Charles Arop, who had surrendered some weeks earlier, he gave detailed information about the Sudanese connection.

Moscow subsequently repeatedly expressed its support for the Derg’s “national democratic revolution program”. Large-scale arms shipment from the USSR commenced immediately and in September the first Soviet arms to arrive in Eritrea were reported to show up in fierce battles around Asmara. Furthermore, an estimated 1000 Soviet Union military personnel arrived in the country in late 1977, putting the Ethiopian army through a crash course in the use of Soviet aircraft and equipment. Additionally, 60 Ethiopian fighter pilots received training in the Soviet Union. Apart from providing arms and training, the Soviet Union also sent military advisors to Ethiopia, some of whom were deployed in the disputed Ogaden region, which had been invaded by Somali in July, and some in Eritrea. The advisors in Eritrea were heavily involved in the regional battle-planning.   Cuba also supplied the Derg with military training for the soldiers being deployed in Eritrea. The Cuban specialists manned a training camp in Segameda.   The year 1977 saw the practical consequences of the reversal of South Yemen’s relationships with the parties in the conflict. Up until then, the country had been one of the main supporters of EPLF, but having officially cut off all support the previous year to put themselves in closer step with the policies of the Soviet Union, South Yemen in 1977 began sending troops in aid of the Addis Ababa regime, subsequently providing secondary warring support. Apart from sending two battalions to the disputed Ogaden region, which had been invaded by Somalia in July, South Yemen also deployed troops in Eritrea. It is clear that South Yemeni soldiers drove some of the new Soviet tanks, since the Ethiopian soldiers had yet to learn how to handle them, as well as flew helicopter reconnaissance missions. Apart from the secondary warring (troop) support, South Yemen also sent personnel that filled in as air traffic controllers at the Asmara airport and artillery experts that, backed by Ethiopian foot soldiers, guarded the landing field.   While the Derg denied having any contacts with Israel, authoritative sources suggest that the latter did indeed provide training to the regime’s Airborne Division during the year. Furthermore, the country supplied the Derg with spares for US aircraft and other heavy weapons. The reason for Israel's willingness to assist the Derg regime militarily was that it believed that if it supported Ethiopia, hostile Arab nations would be unable to exert control over the Red Sea and the Bab el Mandeb, which forms its southern outlet.

",1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,"The Soviet Union continued to supply the Derg regime with military equipment in 1978. In Eritrea it was reported that weapons poured in an a rate of 15 – 20 planeloads a day. Furthermore, the 1000 military personnel that had started to arrive in late 1977 remained in the country, training the Ethiopian army in the use of the new material. On 20 November 1978 a 20-year formal Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation was signed, calling among other things for cooperation in military affairs. Apart from supplying arms and training, the Soviet Union also retained its military advisors in Ethiopia. As the interstate conflict with Somalia – fought over the Ogaden region – ended in March 1978, large military resources were freed and could be used in Eritrea. Soviet military advisors had played an important role in Ogaden, and were now moved north, where they were placed in field advisory positions.  East Germany provided the regime with military advisers. A substantial number of the 15 000 East German “experts” deployed in Africa (specializing in security assistance, intelligence and communications) were in fact active in Ethiopia, but it is not possible to give a precise estimate of how many. During the government’s 1978 offensive in Eritrea, some of these military advisors manned artillery and rocket units in Eritrea. East German engineers also built flanking roads that made it possible for Ethiopian tanks to come up behind rebel lines.   Fidel Castro’s Cuba continued to assist the Ethiopian government in 1978. However, its policy towards Eritrea was extremely confusing. Refusing to let Cuban combat troops be redeployed from the Ogaden region to Eritrea, and officially making statements confirming a policy of non-intervention, Castro nevertheless allowed Cuban troops to help the Ethiopians in Eritrea with logistics and planning, with guarding Asmara airport as well as with helping to operate some of the more sophisticated new Soviet Union weapons in the Ethiopian arsenal.   While the Derg denied any connections with Israel, there were rumours of Israeli involvement with the military regime. This was eventually confirmed in early 1978, when the Israeli Foreign Minister Moshe Dayan stated that Israel was providing “certain arms” to Ethiopia. The reason for Israel’s willingness to assist the Derg regime militarily was that it believed that if it supported Ethiopia, hostile Arab nations would be unable to exert control over the Red Sea and the Bab el Mandeb, which forms its southern outlet.  South Yemen continued to supply secondary warring support to Ethiopia, i.e. providing soldiers. More specifically, in 1978 the South Yemeni contribution appears to have been a number of pilots flying Ethiopia’s new MiG-21s and MiG-23s.  "

Furthermore, the Soviet Union shipped military hardware to the Ethiopian army, specifically intended for use in the Derg’s offensive in Eritrea.   In May 1979, East Germany and Ethiopia signed an agreement formalizing military relations between the two countries. East Germany subsequently provided the Derg with arms.  In 1979 Libya provided cash for the purchase of 300 000 uniforms from North Korea for the Ethiopian army.  Sudan, traditionally a supporter of the Eritrean rebel groups – albeit not an unwavering one – attempted to improve its relations with Ethiopia during the year. This policy change has been ascribed to a combination of domestic political considerations, recognition of the Derg regime’s military superiority and the failure of Sudanese president Numeiri to obtain support for Eritrean independence in the OAU. As a sign of this conciliation Sudan clamped down on the Eritrean rebel movements in the country and allowed Ethiopian tanks to cross the border during battle.  "

While it is clear that around 16 500 Cuban technicians and advisers served with the Ethiopian forces, operating aircraft and heavy equipment, it is doubtful whether they served in Eritrea. Due to Fidel Castro’s ambivalent stance towards the separatists in the north, it is very likely that the Cuban troops were confined to the rest of the country, aiding the Derg in the other conflicts it was fighting simultaneously.  Cuba is subsequently not included as a secondary supporter to the Ethiopian government in the Eritrean conflict.  "

Moscow subsequently repeatedly expressed its support for the Derg’s “national democratic revolution program”. Large-scale arms shipment from the USSR commenced immediately and in September the first Soviet arms to arrive in Eritrea were reported to show up in fierce battles around Asmara. Furthermore, an estimated 1000 Soviet Union military personnel arrived in the country in late 1977, putting the Ethiopian army through a crash course in the use of Soviet aircraft and equipment. Additionally, 60 Ethiopian fighter pilots received training in the Soviet Union. Apart from providing arms and training, the Soviet Union also sent military advisors to Ethiopia, some of whom were deployed in the disputed Ogaden region, which had been invaded by Somali in July, and some in Eritrea. The advisors in Eritrea were heavily involved in the regional battle-planning.   Cuba also supplied the Derg with military training for the soldiers being deployed in Eritrea. The Cuban specialists manned a training camp in Segameda.   The year 1977 saw the practical consequences of the reversal of South Yemen’s relationships with the parties in the conflict. Up until then, the country had been one of the main supporters of EPLF, but having officially cut off all support the previous year to put themselves in closer step with the policies of the Soviet Union, South Yemen in 1977 began sending troops in aid of the Addis Ababa regime, subsequently providing secondary warring support. Apart from sending two battalions to the disputed Ogaden region, which had been invaded by Somalia in July, South Yemen also deployed troops in Eritrea. It is clear that South Yemeni soldiers drove some of the new Soviet tanks, since the Ethiopian soldiers had yet to learn how to handle them, as well as flew helicopter reconnaissance missions. Apart from the secondary warring (troop) support, South Yemen also sent personnel that filled in as air traffic controllers at the Asmara airport and artillery experts that, backed by Ethiopian foot soldiers, guarded the landing field.   While the Derg denied having any contacts with Israel, authoritative sources suggest that the latter did indeed provide training to the regime’s Airborne Division during the year. Furthermore, the country supplied the Derg with spares for US aircraft and other heavy weapons. The reason for Israel's willingness to assist the Derg regime militarily was that it believed that if it supported Ethiopia, hostile Arab nations would be unable to exert control over the Red Sea and the Bab el Mandeb, which forms its southern outlet.

Furthermore, the 1000 military personnel that had started to arrive in late 1977 remained in the country, training the Ethiopian army in the use of the new material. On 20 November 1978 a 20-year formal Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation was signed, calling among other things for cooperation in military affairs. Apart from supplying arms and training, the Soviet Union also retained its military advisors in Ethiopia. As the interstate conflict with Somalia – fought over the Ogaden region – ended in March 1978, large military resources were freed and could be used in Eritrea. Soviet military advisors had played an important role in Ogaden, and were now moved north, where they were placed in field advisory positions.  East Germany provided the regime with military advisers. A substantial number of the 15 000 East German “experts” deployed in Africa (specializing in security assistance, intelligence and communications) were in fact active in Ethiopia, but it is not possible to give a precise estimate of how many. During the government’s 1978 offensive in Eritrea, some of these military advisors manned artillery and rocket units in Eritrea. East German engineers also built flanking roads that made it possible for Ethiopian tanks to come up behind rebel lines.   Fidel Castro’s Cuba continued to assist the Ethiopian government in 1978. However, its policy towards Eritrea was extremely confusing. Refusing to let Cuban combat troops be redeployed from the Ogaden region to Eritrea, and officially making statements confirming a policy of non-intervention, Castro nevertheless allowed Cuban troops to help the Ethiopians in Eritrea with logistics and planning, with guarding Asmara airport as well as with helping to operate some of the more sophisticated new Soviet Union weapons in the Ethiopian arsenal.   While the Derg denied any connections with Israel, there were rumours of Israeli involvement with the military regime. This was eventually confirmed in early 1978, when the Israeli Foreign Minister Moshe Dayan stated that Israel was providing “certain arms” to Ethiopia. The reason for Israel’s willingness to assist the Derg regime militarily was that it believed that if it supported Ethiopia, hostile Arab nations would be unable to exert control over the Red Sea and the Bab el Mandeb, which forms its southern outlet.  South Yemen continued to supply secondary warring support to Ethiopia, i.e. providing soldiers. More specifically, in 1978 the South Yemeni contribution appears to have been a number of pilots flying Ethiopia’s new MiG-21s and MiG-23s.  "

Furthermore, the Soviet Union shipped military hardware to the Ethiopian army, specifically intended for use in the Derg’s offensive in Eritrea.   In May 1979, East Germany and Ethiopia signed an agreement formalizing military relations between the two countries. East Germany subsequently provided the Derg with arms.  In 1979 Libya provided cash for the purchase of 300 000 uniforms from North Korea for the Ethiopian army.  Sudan, traditionally a supporter of the Eritrean rebel groups – albeit not an unwavering one – attempted to improve its relations with Ethiopia during the year. This policy change has been ascribed to a combination of domestic political considerations, recognition of the Derg regime’s military superiority and the failure of Sudanese president Numeiri to obtain support for Eritrean independence in the OAU.

Apart from this, the country gave other types of support to the government for use in the other conflicts it was fighting simultaneously, i.e. the intrastate one over Eritrea and the interstate one with Somalia.   While the Derg denied any connections with Israel, there were rumours of Israeli involvement with the military regime. This was eventually confirmed in early 1978, when the Israeli Foreign Minister Moshe Dayan stated that Israel was providing ""certain arms"" to Ethiopia. The reason for Israel's willingness to assist the Derg regime militarily was that it believed that if it supported Ethiopia, hostile Arab nations would be unable to exert control over the Red Sea and the Bab el Mandeb, which forms its southern outlet.  From late 1977 Cuba had sent combat troops to support the Ethiopian government in its conflict with both Somalia (see the section on the Ethiopia – Somalia conflict) and WSLF. The number of Cuban troops deployed in the Ogaden increased dramatically during the first two months of 1978, going from 3000 in January to around 18 000 in February. Apart from deploying troops in the Ogaden, Cuba also provided a large number of Cuban military instructors who were actively engaged in the training of Ethiopian military personnel at some 12 institutions and schools.

With the outbreak of the interstate conflict between Eritrea and Ethiopia, the latter saw the need to end its belligerent relationship with Sudan in order to be able to fully focus on Asmara. Also Sudan was at this time in dire need of improving its relations with its eastern neighbour and the two started working towards a better relationship. This had consequences for the rebel groups that Ethiopia and Sudan had supported, with the two governments stopping, or at least drastically reducing this aid.   Apart from the improved relations between Ethiopia and Sudan, the interstate conflict also had an effect on Eritrea’s policy towards the rebels fighting against Addis Ababa. Asmara subsequently started providing support to among other groups OLF as a part of its military strategy in the interstate conflict. This was done so that Addis Ababa would be forced to redeploy some of its troops from the northern border to the south. Thus, in 1998 Asmara trained OLF fighters in Eritrea and then shipped them to Ethiopia through Somalia. Furthermore, Eritrea also supplied arms through Somalia, where OLF had joint bases with ONLF (Ogaden National Liberation Front), fighting for the independence for the Ogaden region. In addition, the Oromo rebels were allowed to open an office in Asmara, where the OLF leadership was subsequently based.

(include paragraph or not?)In the period following Doe's overtake, US support to Liberia increased dramatically. This can, in all likelihood, better be understood as Cold War positioning rather than as an indication of the US supporting Doe's coup.

Reportedly, Ford and Kissinger were aware of the Indonesian plan to invade and allegedly asked Suharto to wait until the American delegation had left Jakarta. During the visit the Americans pledged a substantial increase in the military aid to Indonesia in the following year. Consequently, the U.S. military aid more than doubled from $17 million in 1974 to $40 million in 1976. The U.S. administration never officially or formally approved of the Indonesian occupation of East Timor but however claimed to 'understand' it. Indonesia was part of the US military training network IMET (International Military Education and Training.). As the attack occurred in December, no material support was extended by the U.S. to Indonesia until the end of the year."

The Wahhabis' efforts were in line with this ambition. During the warring parties' fighting, the Basayev/Khattab forces moved in to the north of the villages. Even if the Chechen Islamists never directly linked up with the Wahhabis, there were very close connections between the two groups. Many leading Wahhabi militants joined the Chechen incursion in early August, led by Basayev and Khattab. Furthermore, Khattab, a Saudi Arabian ""missionary"", had strong personal links with the Wahhabis. He also gave a statement saying that the major attacks in Russians cities in September were a response to what the Russians had done in the two Wahhabi villages."

At least certain factions fighting for ARS/UIC, and some of its allies inside Somalia, are known to have received support in the form of arms, ammunition or money from Eritrea. There are also credible eyewitness reports that Eritrea provided military training to armed opposition groups in Somalia, with the UN putting the number of trainees in the hundreds. While Eritrean support is thought to have been carried out with the tacit consent of senior levels of the Eritrean government, operational responsibility remained with the country's intelligence services. It remains unclear to what extent Harakat Ras Kamboni specifically has benefited from Eritrean support. Al-Shabaab also received money from groups in Iran and Saudi Arabia in 2008. However, there is no conclusive evidence to support the claim that Harakat Ras Kamboni benefited from the support."

Both countries issued strongly worded statements, urging the departure of the elite guard and announced the suspension of assistance and of other cooperation with the Comoros pending a resolution of the conflict. Since France is Comoros' chief supplier of funds and South Africa the second largest backer, this was a serious blow to the country's already fragile economy, which is largely dependent on foreign aid. To pile on the pressure, France also assembled an impressive naval task force in the area. Even if President Mitterrand in a statement ruled out the use of French troops, four French warships carrying 90 Marine commandos were reported to be cruising just over the horizon off Moroni, the largest island in the Comoros."

This was stated by Taleban spokespersons. Allegations were, however, levelled against the Taleban and al-Qaeda that such cooperation did exist. Especially, Western sources state that the notorious Taleban commander Siraj Haqqani facilitated cooperation with al-Qaeda."

Hizb-ut-Tahrir denied any involvement in any armed attacks, and claimed that the government used these as an excuse to intimidate political opposition.  Analysts remarked that the language used in the statements of JIG is crude and remarkably different in style from Hizb's developed media statements. The government also made several accusations of al-Qaeda involvement in the JIG organisation. Since JIG was formed, in part, by veterans of IMU who had fought with al-Qaeda in Afghanistan, some support in the form of training is likely. In the attacks, the JIG had to capture arms from government soldiers to return fire why substantial financial or material help from the outside seems unlikely. Evidence was presented that there was a partial Kazakh involvement in JIG, and that the operation had been planned in southern Kazakhstan. In September 2004, the Kazakh president acknowledged that the region has a problem with militant Islamists. The Kazakh and Uzbek security services claimed to work together in the investigation of the incidents in Uzbekistan."
